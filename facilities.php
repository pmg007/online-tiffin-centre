							Regular dabba service providers have repetitive menus and at times include food items that are often disliked. You either get annoyed but somehow put up with the service or you end up ordering food from your neighbouring food joint which is not really healthy and an expensive affair.
							</div>
							<div>
								You get to choose whatever you like for your next meal. The menu does not feel repetitive anymore and you have a tasty well balanced affordable meal.
